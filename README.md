# Wasteland
My friend Obamallama is making an apocalyse-themed Minecraft server,
which is in many ways the spiritual successor to the Minecraft servers Skuli_Steinulf and I used to run.

This plugin will implement the custom functionality for that server that he cannot accomplish through existing plugins.
The system we (Skuli and I) originally used to implement our custom functionality is long dead,
so Obama cannot simply copy over the original code.
I will also be implementing new features that did not exist in the original server.

Obama has not been working on the server for a few months now, but still intends to continue.
I will continue work on this plugin when that time comes.

## Current Features
* Tracks how many zombies or husks a player kills.
* Supports a ranking system for players based on the U.S. Marines' ranks.

## Planned Features
* Make zombies horde more intelligently.
* Special world effects.
* A lot of stuff, generally, but it's been a few months so I don't remember it all. I'll add it here when work begins again.
