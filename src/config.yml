# Officer ranks cannot be obtained by killing zombies.
# They must manually be set using permissions.
# Setting permissions for any rank also gives permissions for all previous ranks.
# You may also optionally specify a rank `description`,
# which will be listed to describe what a staff member of that rank does,
# or what a donor of that rank donated.

# It may be best to remove ranks that you are not using to avoid cluttering the ranks list.
